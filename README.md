## Features

## Usage

### Running Manual Audit

1. In Google Sheets, click **Drive Audit** → **Run Audit Now**
2. You'll see a message that the audit is starting. Click OK to begin
3. The audit runs in the background with automatic continuation every minute:
   - ⏳ Check the **"Audit Status"** sheet for real-time progress
   - 📊 Or click **Drive Audit** → **Check Audit Status**
   - ⚡ Works in chunks of about 5 minutes; you can close the sheet while it runs
4. When complete, review the results in the "Drive Audit" sheet

### Checking Audit Status

Click **Drive Audit** → **Check Audit Status** to see:
- Current status (Running, Completed, Cancelled, or Error)
- Progress percentage
- Last update time
- Estimated time remaining

### Resuming a Stalled Audit

The audit recovers by itself, so you normally never need this. If the "Audit Status" sheet shows **PAUSED**, or "Last Updated" hasn't changed for more than a day:

1. Click **Drive Audit** → **Resume Stalled Audit**
2. The audit continues from where it stopped; results already collected are kept

### Cancelling a Running Audit

If you need to stop an audit that's currently running:

1. Click **Drive Audit** → **Cancel Running Audit**
2. Confirm that you want to cancel
3. The audit will be stopped immediately

**What happens when you cancel:**
- ✅ Audit process stops
- ✅ Continuation triggers are removed
- ✅ Results already written to the sheet remain
- ✅ You can start a new audit anytime

### Setting Up Scheduled Audits

1. Click **Drive Audit** → **Setup Weekly Schedule**
2. Click "Yes" to confirm
3. The audit will now run automatically every Monday at 6:00 AM

### Removing Scheduled Audits

1. Click **Drive Audit** → **Remove Schedule**
2. The weekly audit schedule will be removed
3. You can still run audits manually anytime from the Drive Audit menu

### Understanding the Results

**Audit Status Sheet:**
- 🟢 **COMPLETED** (green) - Audit finished successfully
- 🟡 **RUNNING** (yellow) - Audit is in progress
- 🛑 **CANCELLED** (gray) - Audit was cancelled by user
- ⏸️ **PAUSED** (orange) - The audit couldn't schedule its next step; use **Resume Stalled Audit**
- 🔴 **ERROR** (red) - An error occurred
- Shows real-time progress percentage
- Last updated timestamp
- Detailed status message

**Audit Summary Sheet:**
- Shows total files and permissions audited
- Displays audit date and time
- Provides next steps and tips

**Drive Audit Sheet:**
- One row per permission (files with multiple permissions have multiple rows)
- Use filters to find:
  - Files shared with "anyone with the link"
  - Files shared with external domains
  - Files with specific permission roles
  - Files owned by specific users

## Common Use Cases

### Find Publicly Shared Files
Filter the "Permission Type" column for "anyone"

### Find Externally Shared Files
Filter the "Permission Email" column for domains outside your organization

### Find Files You Own
Filter the "Owner" column for your email address

### Find Files with Edit Access
Filter the "Permission Role" column for "writer" or "editor"

## OAuth Scopes

This script requires the following permissions:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.currentonly` - To read and write to the current spreadsheet
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` - To read Drive files and permissions
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.scriptapp` - To create scheduled triggers
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui` - To display HTML dialogs and user interface

## Troubleshooting

### "Authorization Required" Error
- Make sure you've authorized the script when first opening the sheet
- Try running the audit manually first before setting up a schedule

### "Drive API has not been enabled" Error
- Open the Apps Script editor (`clasp open`)
- Add the Google Drive API service (see installation steps)

### Audit Takes Too Long / Timeout Errors
- **No longer an issue!** The tool now uses batch processing with 1-minute continuation intervals
- For very large Drive accounts (10,000+ files):
  - The audit automatically pauses before timeout (at 4.5 minutes)
  - It saves its progress and schedules a continuation in 1 minute
  - This repeats until all files are processed
  - You can monitor progress in the "Audit Status" sheet
  - The entire process is automatic - no manual intervention needed

### Audit Seems Stuck ("Last Updated" Stopped Changing)
- Google limits how long scripts may run in the background per day: about 90 minutes for free Gmail accounts and 6 hours for Google Workspace accounts
- When a very large audit uses up that allowance, it waits and continues by itself once the limit resets (within 24 hours). Nothing is lost
- **Don't start a new audit** - that discards the results collected so far
- If the status is still unchanged a day later, click **Drive Audit** → **Resume Stalled Audit**

### Missing Files
- The tool only shows files you have access to
- Files in shared drives require the `supportsAllDrives` parameter (already included)
